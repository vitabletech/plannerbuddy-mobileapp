## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Ruby Environment Setup
**Problem:** CocoaPods installation failed due to Ruby version incompatibility
- **Issue:** Ruby 2.6.10 was too old (CocoaPods requires Ruby >= 3.1.0)
- **Solution:** Installed CocoaPods 1.10.1 which is compatible with Ruby 2.6.x

**Commands Used:**
```bash
# Check Ruby version
ruby --version  # Output: ruby 2.6.10p210

# Install compatible CocoaPods version
gem install cocoapods -v 1.10.1 --user-install

# Add gem binaries to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Fix FFI gem for Apple Silicon
gem install ffi --user-install
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ CocoaPods 1.10.1 successfully installed

### 2. Ruby Version Manager Installation
**Attempted rbenv installation for future Ruby upgrades:**
```bash
# Install rbenv manually
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"
```

**Note:** Installation was partially completed but not fully configured due to admin permission requirements.

### 3. iOS Simulator Setup
**Problem:** No iOS simulators available
- **Issue:** iOS Simulator was installed but no iOS runtimes were downloaded

**Solution Steps:**
```bash
# Check iOS Simulator installation
xcode-select -p  # Output: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Check available runtimes (initially empty)
xcrun simctl list runtimes

# Install iOS runtime
xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS
# Successfully downloaded: iOS 26.0 (23A343)

# Create iPhone 15 simulator
xcrun simctl create "iPhone 15 - PlannerBuddy" "iPhone 15" "iOS26.0"
# Created simulator with ID: 8A2E64BF-1493-40CA-B7A6-82A5FD7D73E3

# Boot the simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 - PlannerBuddy"

# Open Simulator app
open -a Simulator
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ iOS Simulator successfully set up and running

### 4. Expo Development Server
**Problem:** SSL certificate issues when connecting to Expo API
- **Error:** `unable to get local issuer certificate` when fetching from `api.expo.dev`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Start Expo in offline mode to bypass SSL issues
npx expo start --offline
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Expo development server running successfully in offline mode

## üìù Key Commands for Reference

### Start Development Server:
```bash
npx expo start --offline  # Offline mode (current working method)
npx expo start            # Online mode (has SSL issues)
```

### iOS Simulator Management:
```bash
# List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices

# Boot simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 - PlannerBuddy"

# Open Simulator app
open -a Simulator
```

### CocoaPods Commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd ios && pod install

# Check CocoaPods version
pod --version
```

---

## üí° Notes & Troubleshooting

### SSL Certificate Issues:
If you encounter SSL certificate errors, use `--offline` flag with Expo commands as a workaround.

### Admin Permissions:
Some installations (like Homebrew) require administrator privileges. Alternative manual installations were used where needed.

### Ruby Version:
While Ruby 2.6.10 is older, it works fine with CocoaPods 1.10.1 for current development needs. Upgrading to Ruby 3.2+ can be done later if needed.
